# Project Documentation

### This repository contains my completed work for the Math 354 project instructions, including Excel files, VBA code, R scripts, and the four-fold data splits used for model construction.

## 1. Excel User Interface & Pivot Table

### I built an interactive Excel user interface that allows the user to select a state from a drop-down list. The interface automatically displays the following values for the selected state:

* Average Speed
* Max Speed
* Average Age
* Max Age
* Min Age

To produce these results, I first created a Pivot Table that summarized all required statistics by state. Then, I connected the user interface to the Pivot Table using GETPIVOTDATA so the displayed results update dynamically when a different state is selected.

2. Excel VBA: Two-Dimensional Loop (25 pts)

I wrote a nested loop in VBA that generates the numerical pattern required in the exam. The loops iterate through rows and columns, printing values in the correct structured format.

After the loop finishes, I included a single additional line of code that prints my name next to the value 252, as instructed.

The macro is stored in the Excel file as a micro-enabled workbook (.xlsm).

3. R Loop for Summation (14 pts)

Using R, I wrote a manual loop (not vectorized) that calculates the sum of the sequence provided in the exam.
The script initializes an accumulator variable and adds to it inside the loop, storing and printing the final total at the end.

4. Model Construction Using R (36 pts)
4.1 Data Preparation

I converted the full dataset (All) into a CSV file.

I randomly split the data into four evenly sized folds and saved each fold as its own CSV file (fold1.csv, fold2.csv, etc.).

4.2 Four-Fold Cross-Validation

For each of the four iterations:

I used three folds as the training data.

I created predictions for the remaining fold (the test fold).

I combined the predictions with the test fold using cbind().

After processing all folds, I merged them using rbind() to create one full dataset containing predictions for every observation.

I computed the A/E ratio, verifying that it was not exactly 100%, as required.

4.3 Final Linear Model

I fit the final required linear model using the full dataset.
I then calculated the A/E ratio for this final model, which correctly produced an A/E of 100%.
